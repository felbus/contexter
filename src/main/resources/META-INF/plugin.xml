    <description>
        This plugin helps you build a context to ask Gen AI a question. It will automatically search for files in your codebased so you can add the contexts of those files to the context. It also contains extra boxes so that you can add more context like functions and a final prompt. You can add a file named contexter.txt to the root of your repo, and it will pick that up every time and add it to the beginning of your context. This may be a description of your project. As it is built to help you add files, a god idea is to add some comments to the top of each of your files that you are likely to add that explains what they are, this will help the Gen AI answer your prompts better.
